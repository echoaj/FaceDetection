The project includes several programs dealing with facial recognition.
In findFaces.py, the program will output the number of faces detected in a photo
In faceMatch.py we feed president Obama's face to the system and compare it to another picture.
The program will determine if it is him.
In findPersonInPhoto.py, the program will determine if Obama was found in an image with a group of people.

In videoFaceRecognition.py, the video camara on your labtop will turn on and determine when it spots a person's face.
It will draw a square around the face if it detects it.  Your face is closer to the camera, the square
will be more green and if you are farther way, the square will be more red.
